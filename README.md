## üöÄ Quick Installation

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mostaghell/ServerPass/releases)
2. Extract to your FiveM server root directory
3. Run `install.bat` (Windows) or `install.sh` (Linux)
4. Edit `resources/[local]/serve-pass/config.lua` with your settings
5. Restart your server

### Manual Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Copy the `serve-pass` folder to your `resources/[local]/` directory
3. Add `ensure serve-pass` to the **top** of your `server.cfg`
4. Configure the resource (see Configuration section)
5. Restart your FiveM server

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Setup

Edit `config.lua` to customize ServePass:

```lua
-- Basic Settings
Config.Password = "your_secure_password_here"  -- Change this!
Config.MaxAttempts = 3                         -- Max password attempts
Config.KickOnMaxAttempts = true               -- Kick after max attempts

-- Security Features
Config.EnableRateLimit = true                 -- Enable rate limiting
Config.EnableWhitelist = false               -- Enable whitelist mode
Config.EnableLogging = true                  -- Enable detailed logging
```

### Advanced Configuration

```lua
-- Rate Limiting
Config.RateLimitWindow = 300        -- 5 minutes
Config.MaxAttemptsPerWindow = 5     -- Max attempts per IP

-- Logging
Config.LogLevel = "INFO"            -- DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
Config.LogFile = "servepass.log"    -- Log file name

-- UI Customization
Config.UISettings = {
    title = "Server Authentication",
    subtitle = "Please enter the server password",
    placeholder = "Enter password..."
}
```

### Server.cfg Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Place ServePass at the top of your resource list:

```cfg
# ServePass - Load FIRST for early authentication
ensure serve-pass

# Core Resources
ensure chat
ensure spawnmanager
ensure sessionmanager

# Other Resources
# ... your other resources here
```

## Usage

### For Players

1. **Connect**: Join the server normally through FiveM
2. **Spawn**: Wait for your character to spawn in the world
3. **Authentication**: A modern password prompt will appear automatically
4. **Enter Password**: Type the server password (case-sensitive)
5. **Submit**: Click "Submit" or press Enter to authenticate
6. **Play**: Once authenticated, all restrictions are lifted

**Note**: While unauthenticated, you cannot:
- Move your character
- Use chat, weapons, or vehicles
- Access phone, map, or pause menu
- Interact with the world

### For Administrators

#### Console Commands

All admin commands must be executed from the **server console**:

```bash
# Check authentication status
servepass:status

# Kick all unauthenticated players
servepass:kickunauthenticated

# Change server password
servepass:changepassword <new_password>
```

#### Command Examples

```bash
# View current player status
servepass:status
# Output: [ServePass] Players: 15 total, 12 authenticated, 3 pending

# Remove unauthenticated players
servepass:kickunauthenticated
# Output: [ServePass] Kicked 3 unauthenticated players

# Change password securely
servepass:changepassword MyNewSecurePassword123
# Output: [ServePass] Password changed successfully
```

## How It Works

1. **Connection**: Players connect to the server normally
2. **Spawn**: When a player spawns, they are marked as unauthenticated
3. **Password Prompt**: A modern web UI appears requiring password input
4. **Restrictions**: Unauthenticated players cannot:
   - Move or control their character
   - Use chat, weapons, vehicles, or other features
   - Access phone, map, or pause menu
5. **Authentication**: Players enter the password through the web interface
6. **Verification**: Server validates the password and either:
   - Removes restrictions if correct
   - Shows error and allows retry if incorrect
7. **Full Access**: Only authenticated players can fully participate in gameplay

## üîí Security Features

### Built-in Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks with configurable windows
- **Attempt Limiting**: Configurable maximum attempts before kick
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic cleanup
- **IP Tracking**: Monitor and log authentication attempts by IP
- **Whitelist Support**: Optional whitelist for trusted players
- **Admin Bypass**: Automatic authentication for administrators

### Security Best Practices
- **Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords with mixed characters
- **Regular Updates**: Keep ServePass updated to the latest version
- **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check authentication logs for suspicious activity
- **Backup Config**: Keep secure backups of your configuration
- **Console Access**: Restrict server console access to trusted administrators

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Password Prompt Not Appearing
```bash
# Check resource status
refresh
ensure serve-pass

# Verify in server console:
# [ServePass] ServePass system initialized successfully
```

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure `serve-pass` is at the top of your `server.cfg`
2. Check for script errors in server console
3. Verify all files are present in the resource folder
4. Restart the resource: `restart serve-pass`

#### Authentication Failures
```bash
# Check logs for errors
servepass:status

# Common log entries:
# [WARN] Player entered incorrect password
# [ERROR] Failed to get identifier for connecting player
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify password in `config.lua` (case-sensitive)
2. Check for special characters or encoding issues
3. Ensure player identifiers are working correctly
4. Test with a simple password first

#### UI/NUI Issues
```bash
# Client-side debugging (F8 console)
resmon

# Look for:
# NUI errors
# Resource loading issues
# JavaScript console errors
```

**Solutions:**
1. Clear FiveM cache and restart
2. Check `html/` folder contains all files
3. Verify no conflicting resources
4. Test with default UI settings

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in `config.lua`:
```lua
Config.DebugMode = true
Config.LogLevel = "DEBUG"
```

This provides detailed logging for troubleshooting.

## üé® Customization

### UI Customization

Modify `config.lua` for basic UI changes:
```lua
Config.UISettings = {
    title = "Your Server Name",
    subtitle = "Enter the secret code",
    placeholder = "Secret code...",
    submitText = "Enter",
    cancelText = "Leave"
}
```

### Advanced UI Styling

Edit files in the `html/` folder:
- **`index.html`** - Structure and layout
- **`style.css`** - Colors, fonts, and animations
- **`script.js`** - Interactive behavior

#### Custom Theme Example
```css
/* Dark theme in html/style.css */
.container {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3c72 0%, #2a5298 100%);
}

.modal {
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);
    border: 1px solid #00ff88;
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0, 255, 136, 0.3);
}

.input-field {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
    border: 1px solid #00ff88;
    color: #00ff88;
}
```

### Adding Features

ServePass is designed to be extensible:

```lua
-- Example: Custom authentication logic
function CustomAuth.validatePlayer(source, password)
    -- Add your custom validation here
    -- Database checks, API calls, etc.
    return true -- or false
end
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Log Analysis

ServePass generates detailed logs for monitoring:

```bash
# Authentication events
[INFO] Authentication SUCCESS - Player: John [steam:123] - Attempts: 1
[WARN] Authentication FAILED - Player: BadActor [steam:456] - Attempts: 3

# Security events
[WARN] Security Event: RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED - IP: 192.168.1.100
[WARN] Security Event: MAX_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED - Player: Hacker [steam:789]

# System events
[INFO] System Event: PASSWORD_CHANGED - Details: Console
[INFO] System Event: STARTUP - Details: ServePass initialized
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Check resource performance
resmon

# Monitor player counts

# Track authentication success rate
# Review logs for patterns and issues
```
